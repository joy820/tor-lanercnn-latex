Forecasting the future behaviors of dynamic actors is an important task in many robotics
applications such as self-driving.  
It is extremely challenging as actors have latent intentions 
and their trajectories are governed by complex interactions between the other actors,
themselves, and the maps.
In this paper, we propose LaneRCNN, 
a graph-centric motion forecasting model.
Importantly, relying on a specially designed graph encoder, we learn a local
graph representation per actor (LaneRoI) to encode its past motions and the local map topology.
We further develop an interaction module which permits efficient message
passing among local graph representations within a shared global lane graph.
Moreover, we parameterize the output trajectories based on lane graphs, a more amenable prediction parameterization.
Our LaneRCNN captures the actor-to-actor and the actor-to-map relations in a
distributed and structured manner.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the challenging Argoverse motion
forecasting benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
