\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose LaneRCNN, a graph-centric motion forecasting model.
Relying on learnable graph operators, LaneRCNN builds a distributed lane-graph-based
representation (\textit{LaneROI}) per actor to encode its past motion and the local map topology.
Moreover, we propose an interaction module which effectively captures the interactions among actors within the shared global lane graph.
And lastly, we parameterize the output trajectory using lane graphs which helps improve the prediction.
We demonstrate that LaneRCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark.
